Project Description: Quiz Game System 
The aim of this project is to design and develop a quiz game platform that allows users to participate 
in interactive quizzes. The system will feature dynamic question fetching and scoring functionality, 
making it engaging and educational for users.
Features:
1. Player Registration:
o Allow users to register and log in with their name and unique identifier (e.g., email 
or username).
2. Quiz Gameplay:
o Display multiple-choice questions to the user one by one.
o Provide a timer for each question (e.g., 10–30 seconds) to maintain 
engagement.(Optional)
o Track and update the score for correct answers.
3. Dynamic & Random Question Fetching:
o Fetch quiz questions using one of the following methods:
▪ File Handling: Store questions locally in text or JSON files.
▪ Database Integration: Retrieve questions from a database with categories or 
difficulty levels.
▪ API Usage: Fetch questions dynamically using an external API (e.g., Open 
Trivia API).
4. Scoreboard:
o Display a final score summary at the end of the quiz.
o Optionally show a leaderboard to compare scores of multiple players.
Expected Deliverables:
• A console-based application with a functional quiz.
• Random question retrieval from the chosen storage method (file, database, or API).
• Proper exception handling for invalid inputs or connectivity issues (if using APIs).
Additional Features (Optional):
• Support for multiple categories (e.g., General Knowledge, Science, History).
• Difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) for personalized quizzes.
• Multiplayer mode: Allow multiple players to join a session and compete in real time
